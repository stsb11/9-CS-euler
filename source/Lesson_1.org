- You've written a fair amount of code over the last three years.
- In this project, you'll try writing code for yourself.

- In your first task, you'll work a little bit with variables and =If= statements. 
- Run the program below a few times by clicking the =Play= icon.
  - Can you make the program show each different branch of the conversation?
  - Why do you think the program always finishes with 'Nice talking with you'?
  - Why don't you always get prompted for your feelings about kittens?
- Try this task

- *Silver:* Open this [[https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/112644879/#editor][template]] in a new tab, and finish writing the program above in Scratch. Upload a screenshot of your finished code. 
- *Gold:* Modify the Python program above to remember someone's hot drink order.
  - First should be asked if they prefer tea or coffee.
  - Ask if they take milk with their tea/coffee.
  - Next, they should be asked if they want sugar.
    - If they do, ask how many sugars they'd like.
  - The order should be showed to the user.
  - e.g. 'You drink tea with milk and no sugar.'
- *Platinum:* Make the program more grammatically correct, so it'll say either '1 sugar' or '2/3/4/n sugars'.
- _or_
- Make the Python program say /that's a lot of sugar/ if the user says they want more than 3 sugars.
