- Computers make excellent calculators. This program will show any times table you want.
- You're going to play around with the code below a bit.
- Remember that if you break the program, you can always refresh the browser page and pick up a new version; there's no risk of breaking anything.

- *Silver:* The first task is a bit like an English comprehension task. To collect this badge, answer the following questions:
  1. What is the =while= loop doing in lines 4 and 5? The program will work without it, if you unindent the line underneath it.
  2. The =for= line makes the =multiplier= variable increase by one each time the loop repeats. 
    - What needs to change to make the program start at 2x or 3x instead of 1x?
    - What needs to change to make the program go up to 100x instead of 12x?
  3. What happens if the =print(nextAnswer)= line isn't indented? Why?
- *Gold:* Fizz-buzz task.
